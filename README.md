# botlist.space Translations
The locale files used to translate the site into different languages.

## How to translate
1. Navigate into `locales`
2. Copy `en-us.json` to `locale-name.json` (replace `locale-name` with the short version of the language)
3. Edit the file with proper translations
4. For every language file there is, add the translation `language_name` but replace name with the proper English name of the new language. Then for each of the translations in each file, make sure to spell the new language like that language file would
4. Push new changes to forked repo and submit a PR
